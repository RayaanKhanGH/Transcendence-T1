AI has fundamentally transformed the attacker's toolkit, evolving from merely crafting sophisticated phishing and scam content \u2013 including realistic deepfakes and fake reviews that erode digital trust \u2013 to directly generating malicious scripts as seen with PromptLock, the first AI-driven ransomware. This innovation lowers the barrier to entry for less skilled criminals, allowing them to leverage sophisticated MaaS and RaaS offerings like CloudEyE and the increasingly prevalent Akira and Qilin ransomware, which continue to drive a projected 40% year-over-year increase in incidents, often employing new evasion techniques and EDR killers. The human element remains the weakest link, with social engineering now more reliable than technical exploits; surprisingly, even digitally native Gen Z is highly susceptible to AI-powered scams due to widespread overconfidence. Meanwhile, the attack surface expands rapidly, with notable surges in Android NFC threats (e.g., RatOn), continuous supply chain exploitation (particularly in tech), and the abuse of legitimate communication channels and cloud infrastructure for command and control. Critical sectors like healthcare continue to bear the brunt of attacks, facing exorbitant breach costs, while finance, education, government, and critical infrastructure are under constant pressure from both profit-driven cybercriminals and state-aligned actors deploying destructive malware like HybridPetya, capable of compromising UEFI systems. This confluence of factors demands an urgent strategic pivot towards AI-native defense capabilities, comprehensive, empathetic security education addressing psychological manipulation, robust identity and access management, and multi-layered defenses extending from the supply chain to firmware, recognizing that resilience against these highly adaptive and intelligent adversaries is paramount."

      "title": "F-Alert US Cyber Threats Bulletin \u2013 December 2025 | F\u2011Secure",
      "summary": "### 1. Intelligence Extraction\n\nThe F-Alert US Cyber Threats Bulletin for December 2025 provides a stark overview of a sophisticated and evolving cyber threat landscape, concluding a year where US consumers alone lost an estimated $64.8 billion to scams, impacting 70% of American adults. The report highlights that scams and AI-driven threats were the most prevalent dangers, closely followed by malware. A critical and surprising finding is that Gen Z (18\u201324 years old), despite their digital fluency, are now the most vulnerable demographic, facing 1.6 times the scam risk of older adults and experiencing weekly scam attempts due to their extensive digital footprint, openness to new technologies, and parasocial trust dynamics. AI's role in these scams is predominantly in content generation\u2014from phishing messages to deepfakes and voice cloning\u2014but emerging concerns include its use for high-value target analysis and the deployment of AI chatbots for long-term romance or investment scams. This trend underscores a pivotal shift where humans have become the primary entry point for cybercriminals, with social engineering using psychological manipulation now more reliable than technical exploits. This human vulnerability is exacerbated by a widespread overconfidence, as 80% of US consumers believe they can spot scams, yet 60% of those confident individuals still fall victim. The report also details a deepening crisis of credibility for online review platforms, where AI-generated fake reviews, both positive and negative, are virtually indistinguishable from genuine feedback, leading to trust manipulation and even extortion. The advent of agentic browsers, AI-driven tools that act on a user's behalf for tasks like shopping, presents a dual challenge: immense convenience alongside significant security vulnerabilities that could empower scammers. Traditional shopping scams, exploiting urgency and fear through malicious links and fake storefronts, remain prevalent. On the breach front, Hyundai AutoEver America disclosed a cyber incident exposing sensitive customer data, including Social Security numbers and driver's licenses, highlighting the continuous risk of identity theft. Finally, the report briefly notes the dismantling of a forced-labor scam center by authorities and the rise of NFC malware campaigns employing social engineering and fake websites to trick users into downloading malicious trojans.\n\n### 2. Strategic Implications\n\nThis intelligence indicates several profound strategic implications across cybersecurity, consumer behavior, and technological development. The pervasive use of AI in content generation and, increasingly, for target profiling and long-term engagement, signals a new era of highly sophisticated, personalized, and scalable cyberattacks. This escalating AI weaponization will fundamentally challenge traditional defensive measures and demand a significant investment in AI-driven detection capabilities and user education that addresses psychological manipulation, not just technical red flags. The vulnerability of Gen Z highlights a critical gap in digital literacy, emphasizing that familiarity with technology does not equate to digital safety. This demographic requires targeted education campaigns and accessible proactive protection tools, representing a significant market opportunity for cybersecurity providers.\n\nThe crisis in online reviews, fueled by AI-generated content, risks widespread erosion of trust in digital marketplaces and information sources. Businesses and platforms reliant on consumer feedback face reputational damage and the imperative to develop robust identity verification and fraud detection systems to restore credibility. The emergence of agentic browsers, while promising for efficiency and automation, introduces a potent new attack surface. If security vulnerabilities are not proactively addressed during their development and deployment, these tools could become powerful instruments for automated fraud, data exfiltration, and sophisticated phishing campaigns, requiring a security-by-design approach from developers and rigorous vetting by users.\n\nFurthermore, the persistent success of social engineering underscores that the human element remains the weakest link in the security chain. This necessitates a shift in security strategy from purely technical safeguards to a holistic approach integrating continuous, empathetic security education that addresses cognitive biases and emotional manipulation. Data breaches like Hyundai AutoEver's continue to fuel identity theft, reinforcing the need for continuous credit monitoring and robust identity protection services. For law enforcement and intelligence agencies, the dismantling of forced-labor scam centers, though briefly mentioned, points to an evolving, highly organized criminal infrastructure that transcends purely digital operations, requiring international cooperation and coordinated physical interventions.

      "summary": "### 1. Intelligence Extraction\nThe third quarter of 2025 witnessed a persistently aggressive and evolving cyber threat landscape, marked by a significant volume of attacks across diverse vectors. Kaspersky solutions alone identified and blocked over 389 million online attacks and nearly 21 million malicious objects, underscoring the pervasive nature of the threat. Ransomware remained a dominant force, impacting close to 85,000 unique users globally and demonstrating alarming growth with 2,259 new modifications detected\u2014a substantial increase from the previous quarter. Qilin solidified its position as the most prolific ransomware group, claiming nearly 15% of all victims whose data was published on data leak sites, while Akira and the emerging INC Ransom group also showed heightened activity. Threat actors employed sophisticated tactics, including Scattered Spider's (UNC3944) use of social engineering to compromise VMware ESXi environments, which involved Active Directory password resets, vCenter access, and subsequent ransomware deployment. Concurrently, a new strain, 4L4MD4R ransomware, leveraged a Microsoft SharePoint vulnerability chain to affect over 140 organizations globally. Akira also capitalized on a previously patched SonicWall SSL VPN vulnerability, exploiting stolen credentials to bypass multi-factor authentication even on updated devices. A particularly concerning development was the clear integration of artificial intelligence into ransomware operations: a UK-based actor successfully utilized Claude to construct a ransomware-as-a-service platform, while the novel PromptLock strain directly employed an embedded Large Language Model to dynamically generate attack scripts for various operating systems, with its origins potentially traceable to an academic research project. While threats escalated, law enforcement achieved notable successes globally, including the arrest of a suspect linked to the HardBit ransomware attacks on European airports, the charging of a key administrator behind the LockerGoga, MegaCortex, and Nefilim gangs, significant cryptocurrency seizures from a Zeppelin ransomware distributor, and a coordinated international operation that successfully dismantled the BlackSuit ransomware infrastructure by seizing servers, domains, and over a million dollars in illicit funds. Beyond ransomware, over 254,000 users were targeted by miner attacks, and a proliferation of new spyware and backdoors, such as PasivRobber, ChillyHell, and new variants of XCSSET, demonstrated a particular focus on macOS systems and cryptocurrency theft, often employing obfuscation or valid developer certificates to evade detection. IoT devices remained vulnerable, experiencing a rise in SSH-based attacks, with Germany, the United States, and China identified as primary sources for botnet activity, mainly involving variants of Mirai and Gafgyt.\n\n### 2. Strategic Implications\nThis intelligence points to several critical strategic implications for the broader cybersecurity landscape. Firstly, the accelerating pace of ransomware evolution, particularly with the integration of AI for both platform development and dynamic attack scripting, signals a significant lowering of the barrier to entry for cybercriminals and a rapid increase in the sophistication and evasiveness of malware. Organizations must anticipate a heightened need for adaptive defenses, potentially including their own AI-driven detection and response systems, and a proactive stance against zero-day exploits and multi-stage attacks. Secondly, the successful exploitation of prevalent enterprise platforms like VMware ESXi and Microsoft SharePoint, alongside network devices like SonicWall firewalls, underscores a persistent and critical risk emanating from supply chain vulnerabilities. Even with timely patching, the ability of threat actors like Akira to leverage stolen credentials to bypass MFA highlights the insufficiency of a single-layer security approach and necessitates a comprehensive strategy encompassing robust access controls, continuous monitoring, and employee training against social engineering tactics. Thirdly, the ongoing success of international law enforcement operations against major ransomware gangs, such as BlackSuit, indicates a growing and effective deterrent capability, but the sheer volume of new ransomware modifications suggests that the overall criminal ecosystem remains resilient and adaptable. This \"whack-a-mole\" dynamic implies that while individual groups can be disrupted, the underlying problem requires sustained, coordinated global efforts, alongside private sector collaboration, to truly destabilize the cybercriminal economy. Finally, the observed diversification of targets, with a notable increase in macOS-specific malware and persistent IoT botnet activity, mandates a holistic security strategy that extends beyond traditional Windows environments to encompass all endpoints and connected devices, many of which are often overlooked or perceived as less vulnerable. The discovery that an academic research project may have informed the development of PromptLock also raises ethical considerations regarding the responsible disclosure and potential weaponization of cybersecurity research.\n\n### 3.

      "summary": "### 1. Intelligence Extraction\n\nESET Research's H2 2025 Threat Report, covering the period from June through November 2025 and released on December 16, 2025, unveils a cyber threat landscape significantly escalated by the practical application of artificial intelligence and an increasing sophistication across various attack vectors. A pivotal finding is the transition of AI-powered malware from theoretical concept to tangible reality, exemplified by PromptLock, the first identified AI-driven ransomware capable of dynamically generating malicious scripts. While AI's primary use remains in crafting highly convincing phishing content and scams, this emergence signals a new era of autonomously adapting threats. Simultaneously, NFC threats have seen dramatic growth, with an 87% increase in ESET telemetry, showcasing enhanced scale and sophistication, including the evolution of NGate to incorporate contact stealing, and the introduction of RatOn, a novel malware combining remote access trojan capabilities with NFC relay attacks, often distributed via deceptive Google Play pages and ads mimicking adult TikTok content or digital bank ID services. Brazil, in particular, saw localized campaigns involving PhantomCard, an NGate-based variant.\n\nThe ransomware sector continues its aggressive trajectory, with victim numbers surpassing 2024 totals well before year-end, projecting a 40% year-over-year increase, largely dominated by Ransomware-as-a-Service (RaaS) entities like Akira and Qilin. A new entrant, Warlock, distinguished itself with innovative evasion techniques, while the persistent proliferation of EDR killers underscored the ongoing cat-and-mouse game between attackers and endpoint security solutions. Scams, especially the Nomani investment scheme, exhibited a refinement in tactics, employing higher-quality deepfakes, tell-tale signs of AI-generated phishing sites, and brief, rapidly shifting ad campaigns to evade detection; Nomani scams themselves grew 62% year-over-year, despite a slight decline in H2 2025, and expanded their reach from Meta to YouTube. In the realm of infostealers, the once-dominant Lumma Stealer, despite a brief resurgence following its May 2025 disruption, experienced a precipitous 86% decline in detections, with its key distribution vector, the HTML/FakeCaptcha trojan used in ClickFix attacks, effectively disappearing. Conversely, CloudEyE, also known as GuLoader, dramatically ascended, with detections skyrocketing nearly thirtyfold. This malware-as-a-service downloader and cryptor, typically spread through malicious email campaigns, serves as a conduit for deploying various other threats, including ransomware and prominent infostealers such as Rescoms, Formbook, and Agent Tesla, with Poland bearing the brunt of 32% of all CloudEyE attack attempts in H2 2025.\n\n### 2. Strategic Implications\n\nThe intelligence presented in ESET's H2 2025 Threat Report carries significant strategic implications, highlighting a rapidly evolving threat landscape where technological advancements are increasingly weaponized.
