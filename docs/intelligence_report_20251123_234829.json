      "summary": "ELLE editors are observing a growing trend: elevated athleisure. Unlike the casual streetwear of the 2010s, this trend blends high fashion with sportswear, incorporating luxury fabrics and sophisticated designs. Designers like Tory Burch, Melitta Baumeister, Literary Sport, and Off-White are showcasing this with sequined bodysuits, football jersey dresses, refined running wear, and unexpected pairings like cycling tops with beaded skirts. Comfort and confidence are driving this trend, influenced by the pandemic and a desire to look fit and put-together. The rise of stylish athletes like Angel Reese, luxury sponsorships at the Olympics, and the use of athletic figures like Suni Lee and Scout Bassett in fashion shows underscore the growing connection between fashion and sports.\n",
